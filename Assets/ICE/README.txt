Important Update Information

Dear customers, 
ICECreatureControl v1.1 comes with dozens of improved and new features and also with some structural changes, therefore I would like to recommend you to install the new version in an empty project to learn and understand the changes before updating your given project.
 
To update you project you should remove the old ICE folder from your project before installing the new version to make sure that obsolete files will not been mixed with the new sources.

After importing ICECreatureControl you will see the ICE folder, which contains following folders:
- ICECreatureControl – required core sources 
- ICESharedAssets – required shared sources
- ICEEnvironmentControl – additional asset
- DemoScenes – optional demo scenes 

Open the Window -> ICECreatureControl menu for further information and your first steps.
I hope you will enjoy the work with ICECreatureControl!

Have a nice day!

Sincerely yours, Pit
